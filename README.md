## comments or assumptions
###### 1) The way each animal eats can be diffrent but we did not need to make seperate instances. 
###### 2) That being said theres a list of activitys all animals do: Wake up, make noise, sleep. 
###### 3) We can make the lowest subclass abstract. 
###### 4) We run all the string outputs into a txt file to submite. 
###### 5) When doing the probability we can assume the felines will only do one action when asked to sleep. 
###### 6) There are subclass of a subclass (inheratence)
###### 7) For the random function we used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-random-numbers-in-java/ for the needed inport and for lines 34 and 35 in the zookeeper class. 
###### 8) The zoo class used abstraction. (we didnt know how todo it without abstraction).
###### 9) For writing out files in Java we used https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files_create.asp to get information. 
###### 10) The only present of deficiencies are listed as such in the homework:  "When a Dog is given the exercise command by the Zookeeper,there is a 25% chance the dog will dig instead of roaming. When a Feline is given a sleep command,there is a 30% chance it will roam instead, a 30% chance it will make noise, and a 40% chance it willsleep. When a Pachyderm is given an exercise command, there is a 25% chance it will charge instead ofroam. "

## Issues
###### 1) Through eclips we had to give each class its own file, making it messy and difficult at times to keep track of. 
###### 2) Using codeshare: Internet connection made it hard to see code changes, and reimplementing it into git and eclipse cause a lot more extra work than necessary. 
###### 3) Had an issue setting up the classes and figureing out diffrent subclasses and abstractions. 

## Instructions to run code
###### 1) Download the code or copy the workspace using " git clone https://github.com/br-schneider/project_1.git " in your comand line/ terminal 
###### 2) Open Zoo.java and click run
###### 3) Where it askes for days put in desired days.
###### 4) See that we finished the project with minimal tears.
